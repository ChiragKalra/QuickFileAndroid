# QuickFileAndroid

## About
Quick File Android is the android part of a project that I made for my personal use. It coupled with the web app allows me to share files with public computers with ease by logging in the webapp via an otp.  
This app generates a random OTP on request for logging into the web app and allows you to control file visibiity on the web app.

However it's not very secure but it doesn't matter for all school/college related purposes I had in mind.
